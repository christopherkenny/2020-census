# Project VEST Data to 2020 VTDs

Steps:
1. Match VEST precincts to 2010 Census blocks
2. Add populations to 2010 blocks 
3. Estimate election data down to 2010 blocks
4. Crosswalk election data to 2020 blocks by VEST's land use area.*
5. Aggregate to 2020 VTDs by BAFs

* This differs only in step 4, where it relies on VEST land use area where applicable to crosswalk.
